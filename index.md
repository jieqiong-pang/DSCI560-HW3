## Project Summary
- **What**: MyWonder is a new platform for big data analytics and visualization
- **Why**: Before this new platform come from, create visualizations from massive files need to wait for hours
- **How**: By distributing the files on the cloud can improve the visualization efficient
- **Why good**: Now our users are now able to easily create visualizations from massive files under 10min, and they can calculate their analytics and summaries from their phones very easily, even before jumping to a meeting


## Wastes
- **Skills**: the terminology and contents used in the user interface makes it not very appropriate for demos, and customers don’t understand things like “test visualization”
- **Waiting**: CEO call our customer assistance team constantly, which takes time from CEO meetings with clients.
- **Transport/waiting**: The delivery of customer requirements passes through a number of intermediate departments（designers，developers，backend team),which takes long time to update the customer requirements
